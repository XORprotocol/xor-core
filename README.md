XOR is a modular and democratic decentralized credit protocol built on Ethereum. For a full description, reference our [whitepaper](https://xor.finance/whitepaper.pdf)

This repo is a node package containing the XOR Core logic for the creation of Loan Markets. 

#### ❗️ All the contents of this repo are experimental.

It is not safe to use any of the code in this repo on mainnet until proper smart contract audits have been finished. 

#### ⭐️ Help us make improvements to the protocol by reporting bugs and making contribution to XOR core.

We'd love your help to help us make improvements and determine the future direction of the protocol.

## Installing XOR Core

```sh
yarn install
yarn test
```
